- This code for Motion detector using OpenCV, a library from python.
- if you found this and want to use it
- make sure to have OpenCV library install
- and if Windows 11, make sure allow desktop application use Camera in settings. (or else it wont work)


Note before using this:
- I used gray scale to compare the frame, so you will need dark background, or else the code is confused.
- If you want to tweak it, go ahead.
